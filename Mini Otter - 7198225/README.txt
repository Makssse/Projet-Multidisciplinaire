The low-poly treatment of the body and tail provides structure while maintaining the charm of a compact collectible.The Mini Otter embodies curiosity and playfulness, making it a lively addition to the Mini Zoo’s aquatic category. It complements models like the penguin and seal, representing an important balance between land and water creatures within the collection.Recommended material: PLA+ or PETG for smooth surfaces and durability. Use a medium brown for the body and a lighter cream tone for the chest and muzzle. A 0.16 mm layer height is ideal for capturing the subtle contouring of the face.A little message:Your support helps me keep creating and improving new designs every day.
